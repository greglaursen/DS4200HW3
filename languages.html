    <h1>My Self Studying Language Journey</h1>

    <!-- Placeholder for Your Language Journey Description -->
    <p>I started my language learning journey several years ago, focusing on developing fluency in a range of languages including Spanish and French. My approach is mostly self-guided through apps, books, and conversations with native speakers. I've learned a lot about how languages shape our thinking and open up opportunities for cultural exchange.</p>
